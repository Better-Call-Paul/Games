# The key is that a node can have at most K=15 neighbours.

#Create an adjacency list of the graph using hashmaps. For each node, count how many times each vertex appears as its neighbour of a neighbour. Can be done in O(KÂ²) per node. Overall time complexity O(MK) and space complexity O(M), should be good enough to pass.
